1) What is Pulse Width Modulation?    
	- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used to generate analog signals from digital outputs by varying the duty cycle of a digital pulse.                
	- In an STM32 microcontroller, PWM is typically generated using the timer peripherals.       
	- The timer counts up to a specified value, and the output toggles between high and low states based on the duty cycle, which is set by adjusting the timer's compare register.             
	- By varying the duty cycle, you can control the effective voltage applied to a load, enabling tasks like motor speed control, LED dimming, and more.           
	- **Duty Cycle**: The proportion of time during which the PWM signal is high (on) within a single period.                                   
	- **Frequency**: The number of times the PWM signal completes a full cycle (high and low states) per second. It is measured in Hertz (Hz) and impacts how smoothly the PWM signal controls the load.                            
	- **Period**: The duration of one complete PWM cycle, which is the inverse of the frequency. The period consists of both the high (on) and low (off) times.                 
	- **Resolution**: The granularity with which you can adjust the duty cycle of the PWM signal. It is determined by the bit-width of the timer/counter used for generating the PWM, with higher resolution allowing finer control.
            
2) Understanding PWM mode                         
	- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) mode allows the generation of a signal with a frequency determined by the value in the _TIMx_ARR_ (Auto-Reload Register) and a duty cycle defined by the value in the _TIMx_CCRx_ (Capture/Compare Register).                                                    
	- The PWM mode can be independently selected on each channel by setting the _OCxM_ bits in the _TIMx_CCMRx_ (Capture/Compare Mode Register) to 110 (PWM mode 1) or 111 (PWM mode 2).                                         
    - To enable the corresponding preload register, you must set the _OCxPE_ bit in the _TIMx_CCMRx_ register. Additionally, if using upcounting or center-aligned modes, you should enable the auto-reload preload register by setting the _ARPE_ bit in the _TIMx_CR1_ (Control Register 1).                                 
	- Since the preload registers are only transferred to the shadow registers upon an update event, all registers must be initialized before starting the counter by setting the _UG_ bit in the _TIMx_EGR_ (Event Generation Register).
 
3) Calculating PSC and ARR    

	A time period of 1 second at 50% duty cycle will be at 0.5s.          
                             
	2 seconds ---> 65536 ticks                            
	x seconds ---> 1 tick                        
	
	$T = 30.51us$                                         
	 $F = {1\over T}$                  
	$F = 32.768 KHz$                      
	The frequency required is around 32.768KHz.                  
	
	$Fclk = 8MHz$              
	${Fclk \over PSC} = 32.768K$            
	${8M \over PSC} = 32.768K$                  
	$PSC = 244$                
	
	Counter will count to 65536 ticks in 2 seconds.                   
	A time period of 1 second is required which means ARR is 32768 (65536/2) ticks.             
	The LED will blink at 50% duty cycle which is every 0.5 second - ARR/2.
